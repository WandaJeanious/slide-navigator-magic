            When we provide multiple means of representation, we recognize that children access and process 
            information in different ways. This is particularly important for:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Children learning English as an additional language</li>

            <li>Children with varying levels of background knowledge</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            By providing options for perception, language, and comprehension, we create learning experiences 
            that are accessible to all children from the start, rather than modifying after the fact.
